# Local Voice MCP - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction
**Problem**: Current cloud-based TTS solutions pose privacy risks, introduce latency, and limit user control over voice data.  
**Solution**: Local voice generation using Coqui TTS to process audio directly on user devices.  
**Key Benefits**:
- **Privacy**: Zero data leaves the device
- **Latency**: Optimized response times
- **Control**: Advanced voice customization

### JSON API Schema
```json
{
  "text": "Hello world",
  "voice": "tts_models/en/ljspeech/tacotron2-DDC",
  "options": {
    "pitch": 1.2,
    "speed": 1.0,
    "emotion": "happy",
